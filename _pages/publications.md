My research aims to reduce the noise and compliation overhead problem in NISQ era quantum computer and can be divided to two aspects: Pulse based approach and Gate based approach. And I am also working on extend quantum machine learning into applications in different areas.

I'm grateful for having collaborated with these inspiring people, who guide and help me alot in my research path: [Yongshan Ding (Assistant Professor at Yale)](https://www.yongshanding.com/), [Hanrui Wang (PhD Student at MIT)](https://hanruiwang.me/), [Jinglei Cheng (PhD Candidate at USC)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinglei-cheng-b7235a12b/), [Zhepeng Wang (PhD student at GMU)](https://jqub.github.io/zhepeng/), [Zhirui Hu (Incoming PhD Student at GMU)](https://github.com/happybored), [Zhongrui Wang (Assistant Professor at HKU)](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~zrwang/).
