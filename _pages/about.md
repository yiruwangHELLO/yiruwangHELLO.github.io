I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu/), [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu//), under the supervision of [Professor. Yiyu Shi](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yiyu-shi/) at University of Notre Dame and Assistant [Professor. Weiwen Jiang](https://jqub.github.io/) at George Mason University. <br> 
I received my Bachelor's degree from [University of Wisconsin, Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in Madison, WI, US, where I was worked with [Professor. Juda Shohet](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Shohet_J-/) in the Plasma Processing & Technology lab at UW-Madison.

# Research
My research interests recently focus on **Quantum Machine Learning** and **Quantum Optimal Control**. My research aim to find methods to solve the noise problem in NISQ era quantum computer and reduce the compliation overhead in quantum computer.
